# 18. Using StateContext

StateContext is a one of a most important objects when working with a state machine as it is passed into various methods and callbacks to give status of a current state of a state machine and where it is possibly going. If simplifying things a little it can be considered to be a snapshot of a current state machine stage where it is at a time StateContext is passed on.

> In Spring Statemachine 1.0.x StateContext usage were relatively naive in terms of how it was used to just pass stuff around as a simple POJO. Starting from Spring Statemachine 1.1.x its role has been greatly improved by making it a first class citizen in a state machine.

In overall StateContext can be used as.

- Access to current Message, Event or their MessageHeaders if known.
- Access to state machine Extended State.
- Access to StateMachine itself.
- Access to possible state machine error.
- Access to current Transition if applicable.
- Access to source and target states where state machine is possibly getting from and going to.
- Access to current Stage as described in Section 18.1, “Stages”.

StateContext is passed into various components interacting with user like Action and Guard.
