## 10.6Â Configuring Guards

Guards are used to protect state transitions. Interface_Guard_is used to do an evaluation where method has access to a_StateContext_.

```
@Configuration
@EnableStateMachine
public
class
 Config4
        
extends
 EnumStateMachineConfigurerAdapter
<
States, Events
>
 {

    
@Override
public
void
 configure(StateMachineTransitionConfigurer
<
States, Events
>
 transitions)
            
throws
 Exception {
        transitions
            .withExternal()
                .source(States.S1).target(States.S2)
                .event(Events.E1)
                .guard(guard())
                .and()
            .withExternal()
                .source(States.S2).target(States.S3)
                .event(Events.E2)
                .guardExpression(
"true"
);

    }

    
@Bean
public
 Guard
<
States, Events
>
 guard() {
        
return
new
 Guard
<
States, Events
>
() {

            
@Override
public
boolean
 evaluate(StateContext
<
States, Events
>
 context) {
                
return
 true;
            }
        };
    }

}
```

In above two different types of guard configurations are used. Firstly a simple_Guard_is created as a bean and attached to transition between states`S1`and`S2`.

Secondly a simple SPeL expression can be used as a guard where expression must return a`BOOLEAN`value. Behind a scenes this expression based guard is a_SpelExpressionGuard_. This was attached to transition between states`S2`and`S3`. Both guard in above sample always evaluate to true.
