## 10.7Â Configuring Actions

Actions can be defined to be executed with transitions and states itself. Action is always executed as a result of a transition which originates from a trigger.

```
@Configuration
@EnableStateMachine
public
class
 Config5
1
extends
 EnumStateMachineConfigurerAdapter
<
States, Events
>
 {

    
@Override
public
void
 configure(StateMachineTransitionConfigurer
<
States, Events
>
 transitions)
            
throws
 Exception {
        transitions
            .withExternal()
                .source(States.S1)
                .target(States.S2)
                .event(Events.E1)
                .action(action());
    }

    
@Bean
public
 Action
<
States, Events
>
 action() {
        
return
new
 Action
<
States, Events
>
() {

            
@Override
public
void
 execute(StateContext
<
States, Events
>
 context) {
                
// do something

            }
        };
    }

}
```

In above a single`Action`is defined as bean`action`and associated with a transition from`S1`to`S2`.

```
@Configuration
@EnableStateMachine
public
class
 Config5
2
extends
 EnumStateMachineConfigurerAdapter
<
States, Events
>
 {

    
@Override
public
void
 configure(StateMachineStateConfigurer
<
States, Events
>
 states)
            
throws
 Exception {
        states
            .withStates()
                .initial(States.S1, action())
                .state(States.S1, action(), null)
                .state(States.S2, null, action())
                .state(States.S2, action())
                .state(States.S3, action(), action());
    }

    
@Bean
public
 Action
<
States, Events
>
 action() {
        
return
new
 Action
<
States, Events
>
() {

            
@Override
public
void
 execute(StateContext
<
States, Events
>
 context) {
                
// do something

            }
        };
    }

}
```

| Usually you would not define same`Action`instance for different stages but we did it here not to make too much noise in a code snippet. |

In above a single`Action`is defined as bean`action`and associated with states`S1`,`S2`and`S3`. There is more going on there which needs more clarification:

* We defined action for initial state
  `S1`
  .
* We defined entry action for state
  `S1`
  and left exit action empty.
* We defined exit action for state
  `S2`
  and left entry action empty.
* We defined a single state action for state
  `S2`
  .
* We defined entry action as well as exit action for state
  `S3`
  .
* Notice how state
  `S1`
  is used twice with
  `initial()`
  and
  `state()`
  functions. This is only needed if you want to define entry or exit actions with initial state.

|  | Defining action with`initial()`function only executes particular action when state machine or sub state is started. Think this action to be initializing action which is only executed once. Action defined with`state()`is then executed if state machine is transitioning back and forward between initial and non-initial states. |
