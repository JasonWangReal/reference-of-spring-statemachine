## 10.4Â Configuring Regions

There are no special configuration methods to mark a collection of states to be part of an orthogonal state. To put it simple, orthogonal state is created when same hierarchical state machine has multiple set of states each having a initial state. Because an individual state machine can only have one initial state, multiple initial states must mean that a specific state must have multiple independent regions.
