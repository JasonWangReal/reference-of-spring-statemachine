## 2. Usage Scenarios

A project is a good candidate to use a state machine if:

* The application or part of its structure can be represented as states.
* You want to split complex logic into smaller manageable tasks.
* The application is already suffering concurrency issues with i.e. something happening asynchronously.

You are already trying to implement a state machine if:

* Using boolean flags or enums to model situations.
* Having variables which only have meaning for some part of your application lifecycle.
* Looping through if/else structure and checking if a particular flag or enum is set and then making further exceptions about what to do when certain combinations of your flags and enums exist or don’t exist together.
