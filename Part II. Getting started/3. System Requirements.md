## 3. System Requirements

Spring Statemachine 1.2.8.RELEASE is built and tested with JDK 8\(all artifacts have JDK 7 compatibility\) and Spring Framework 4.3.3.RELEASE and doesn’t require any other dependencies outside of Spring Framework within its core system.

Other optional parts like[Chapter 30,Using Distributed States](https://docs.spring.io/spring-statemachine/docs/1.2.8.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#sm-distributed)has dependencies to a`Zookeeper`, while[Part VI, “State Machine Examples”](https://docs.spring.io/spring-statemachine/docs/1.2.8.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#statemachine-examples)has dependencies to spring-shell and spring-boot which pulls other dependencies beyond framework itself. Also optional security and data access has dependencies to_Spring Security_and_Spring Data Modules_.
